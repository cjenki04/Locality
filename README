IMPLEMENTATIONS
We have correctly implemented all of the required commands as well as 
-rotate 270, -flip horizontal, -flip vertical, and -transpose.
The only thing that may not be correctly implemented is our uarray2b as
it runs slower than our other mapping functions. 
ARCHITECTURE
Our implementation started by reading in the given image file using Pnm_ppmread
after setting the correct methods and mapping function in our Pnm_ppm struct 
and setting that initial map to a Pnm_ppm struct called pixmap. Next, based on
what command line argument was given, that struct was either flipped, rotated,
or transposed. The flipped, rotated, or transposed pixmap was represented by
rpixmap, which copied pixmap in the specified way. Rpixmap is then written 
to stdout. However, if a rotation of 0 is specified, pixmap is the Pnm_ppm
written to stdout.

In a 90 degree rotation, the 2D array will be read in row major order so
spaces in memory will be next to each other.  This will result in maximum
locality for reads. For writes, the columns are not stored in order resulting
in far more misses. However, only a a block-major mapping will be faster
since the elements are in contiguous spaces which in turn minimizes 
cache evictions. The col-major access for the 180 rotation will be the slowest
becuase no elements that are read are stored contiguously in memory. In this 
situation, the cache has barely any effect. However for row-major access, it
will be the fastest becuase the elements will be contiguous in memory for reads
and writes.
